## Description

This is an application for elementary school students which allows to master their equation skills.

The application will replace the manual process of checking students' addition, subtraction, multiplication and division skills. 

Currently a teacher gives a student 80 equation problems (one kind: addition / subtraction / multiplication or division) of the current level. The student should solve as many problems as they can within one minute. The teacher checks the results Based on the results the teacher determines if the level will stay the same or increase. Next time problems of the updated level will be given to the student. Once done with the problems on addition, the subtraction will follow (later multiplication and division).

The app will give the problems, check the results and calculate the level.
